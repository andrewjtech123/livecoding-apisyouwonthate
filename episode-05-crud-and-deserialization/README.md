Dont schedule a video before your friend is about to arrive.

_As a side-note, this video makes me realize how much I dislike the approach AMS takes to deserialization, both in general but specifically for JSON-API. It feels like an after-thought and a bodge, so I've been looking into Roar as a replacement._
